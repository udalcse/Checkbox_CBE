You can install & upgrade the local database by running UpgradeLocalDB.ps1.

Make sure you have SQL Server 2016 installed locally.

Also, ensure you have a system administrator user configurated in SQLServer named checkbox_admin with password checkbox_admin.  That user will create the database and other logins.
